<p><em>It’s really not a matter of when a healthcare crisis will occur in your parent’s life. It’s a matter of when. When that happens, they may well find that they home they once loved cannot ever possibly love them back. And, it fact, it has become their mortal enemy.</em></p>
<p><em>That happened with my father. When his medical crisis occurred, he was only allowed to go one more time to take one last look around. In his wheelchair, he could not navigate the three steps leading into the house. His wheelchair would not even fit through the doorway of the bathroom, let alone navigate the limited space within. And the washer and dryer? They were downstairs in the basement. It was time to move to assisted living.</em></p>
<p><em>Unless you’re proactive now, they may be the same scenario you encounter. And every day you delay is one day closer to a slip, a fall, a fracture and a life changed forever. By taking action in advance, however, you can protect their health and help them “age in place”—which is probably their greatest desire.</em></p>
<p>Once upon a time, your parents had to “child-proof” their home to make it safer for you. Now, if you’re helping to take care of a parent—whether they’re in their own home or yours—it may be time to look at making it safer for them to age-in-place.</p>
<p>Whether you’re working with a professional or working on your own, you can help make your their home much safer and more accessible for a wheelchair or walker. What’s more, you can help them reduce the risk of falls [Fear of Falling]—which happens to 1 in 3 older adults every year in the U.S.</p>

<h3>Working With a Professional</h3>
<h4>Make a plan with a professional</h4>
<p>You may have great experience in home remodeling and have some wonderful ideas. A home assessment by an by an occupational therapist, physical therapist, geriatric care manager or other <a href="https://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/using-an-OT-or-CAPS.html?intcmp=AE-CAR-CAH-IL" target="_blank">certified aging-in-place specialist</a>, however, can put fresh eyes on your parent’s living space to make it easier and safer for them to navigate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/using-an-OT-or-CAPS.html?intcmp=AE-CAR-CAH-IL" target="_blank">AARP</a>, in collaboration with The National Association of Home Builders (<a href="https://www.nahb.org/" target="_blank">NAHB</a>), has also developed Certified Aging-in-Place Specialists (CAPS). CAPS designees are often remodelers, but designers, architects, occupational therapists (OT), and others may have this designation. They can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Recommend updates that will help your parent live independently in his or her own home</li>
    <li>Work with an occupational therapist to develop a home modification or build plan based on the safety and functional needs of an individual or household</li>
    <li>Collaborate with a licensed contractor or interior designer about building and design strategies and techniques for creating attractive, barrier-free living spaces</li>
    <li>Provide information about building codes and standards, useful products and resources, and the costs and time required for common remodeling projects</li>
</ul>
<p>To find a CAPS remodeler or design-build professional, call the NAHB at 800-368-5242 or visit <a href="https://www.nahb.org" target="_blank">nahb.org</a>, search for "Find a Certified Aging-in-Place Specialist" and look for a professional in your area with the CAPS designation. They are generally paid by the hour or receive a flat fee per visit or project.</p>
<p>To find an OT in your area, check with your parent’s physician, health insurance provider or local hospital. They are also generally paid a flat fee per visit and their services may be covered by health insurance.</p>

<h3>Working On Your Own</h3>
<h4>First, eliminate common fall hazards</h4>
<p>According to the National Council on Aging statistics, an older adult is treated in the emergency room for a fall every 11 seconds—making them the leading cause of death from injury among people 65 and older. Many of these are preventable by being more aware of such things as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Waxed floors. They may look nice, but they’re a hip fracture waiting to happen.</li>
    <li>Loose floor rugs. They can easily slip underfoot or pose a trip hazard. Either remove them or make sure edges are secure and/or slip resistant.</li>
    <li>Changes in medication. While you may not be able to change the medication a parent is on, you can be more aware of what they’re on and its potential side effects. Some can increase the risk of dizziness, which increase the risk of falls.</li>
    <li>Low drawer storage. Bending over (particularly to pick something up) could easily cause someone to lose their balance and fall. By oving frequently used items to levels where your parent doesn’t have to bend over to retrieve it can help eliminate that risk.</li>
    <li>Pets. More than 80,000 people a year are sent to the hospital for falls due to pets. While it may not be possible to get rid of a pet. If a dog has a tendency to bolt on a walk and suddenly jerk their lead or likes to jump up your parent, it might be time to evaluate the situation.</li>
    <li>Clutter. Sometimes, there’s just too much furniture to allow careful navigation between rooms. If your parent has to turn sideways to get around furniture or step over electrical cords, it’s easy for them to trip and fall.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next, make easy, inexpensive fixes</h3>
<p>As we age, eyesight and balance become an issue. If both are impaired, you have a dangerous situation. You lessen the chances of a fall if you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add a raised toilet and grab bars.</li>
    <li>Add additional lighting in dark hallways, closets, stairwells and pantries.</li>
    <li>Adjust the thermostat on the water heater so it stays at or under 120 degrees.</li>
    <li>Convert to lever-handle faucets to make water flow and temperature easier for arthritic hands to operate.</li>
    <li>Install nonskid treads on steps.</li>
    <li>Install outdoor motion sensor lights.</li>
    <li>Install smoke and carbon monoxide alarms in the kitchen and bedrooms.</li>
    <li>Keep steps and stairwells clear.</li>
    <li>Obtain an emergency response system such as a pendant/bracelet. The Senior List and Consumer Reports websites offer a comparison of the pros and cons.</li>
    <li>Put railings along the walls.</li>
    <li>Remove locks from bedroom and bathroom doors so you can get in quickly, should your parent fall.</li>
    <li>Remove wheels on chairs. Office-like task chairs at a computer on a hard, flat surface can be particularly dangerous.</li>
    <li>Repair loose carpeting or raised areas of flooring.</li>
    <li>Replace wall-mount shower heads with handheld shower heads on a hose.</li>
    <li>Swap out their recliner for one that automatically raises and lowers.</li>
    <li>Switch out standard doorknobs for lever handles.</li>
    <li>Take advantage of an electronic monitoring program such as such as GrandCare, MyTruSense, SilverLink and Wellness.</li>
    <li>Use treads on the tub or shower floor along with rubber-backed bathmats</li>
</ul>

<h3>Then Look at Making the Home More Accessible</h3>
<p>Once you have the easy fixes out of the way, you can look at actually modifying the home to make it more accessible and user-friendly. You might consider:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A  frameless walk-in shower with a sloped floor instead of a step-over threshold</li>
    <li>A shower chair</li>
    <li>A stair-climber</li>
    <li>Controls and switches that are reachable from a wheelchair or bed</li>
    <li>offset door hinges to make room for a wheelchair, walker or two people walking side by side</li>
    <li>Raised toilet seats</li>
    <li>Textured no-slip strips in the bathtub and shower to lessen the chance of a fall</li>
    <li>Wide doorways and halls</li>
    <li>Zero-threshold entryways</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the many modification you can consider making to your parent’s home. <a href="https://ageinplace.com/at-home/aging-in-place-home-ideas/" target="_blank">Age In Place</a> offers quite a few more. Have a parent with dementia? Both <a href="https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/home-care/info-2017/dementia-home-safety.html" target="_blank">AARP</a> and the <a href="https://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-home-safety.asp" target="_blank">Alzheimer’s Association</a> have a number of suggestions on their websites. </p>

<h3>Can’t Afford Major Modifications?</h3>
<p>While making changes to stairs, bedrooms and/or bathrooms can certainly assist your parent, they could also be too pricey for yours or your parent’s budget. Fortunately, financial assistance may be available through:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Area Agencies on Aging distributes modification and repair funds through the Older Americans Act. To contact your local AAA, reach out to the Eldercare Locator at 1-800-677-1116 or <a href="https://eldercare.acl.gov" target="_blank">https://eldercare.acl.gov</a>.</li>
