<p>It may well be that mom or dad prefer to live at home and “age in place.” They wouldn’t be alone in that desire as <a href="https://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/livable-communities-facts-and-figures.html" target="_blank">AARP</a> found that some 87% of seniors plan to remain in their own homes indefinitely. You may have also made a promise to them that you would never move them “into a home.”</p>
<p>However, as their needs increase, the idea of remaining at home becomes less and less viable. You may not be able to work your job, raise your family and provide care 7 days a week. That’s why it’s important to know the different options available to you in your community.</p>

<h3>1. Family/Friends</h3>
<p>The “foundation of long term care” in the United States is the care provided in one’s own home by family or friends <a href="https://www.caregiver.org/selected-long-term-care-statistics" target="_blank">The preferred choice of most Americans</a>, it is estimated that more than <a href="http://caregiveraction.org/resources/caregiver-statistics" target="_blank">65 million people</a>, some 29% of the population, provide an average of 20 hours per week of care for a chronically ill, disabled or aged family member in any given year.</p>
<h4>Cost</h4>
<p>While long–term care insurance may pay for some of this care, 78% of adults in need of caregiving rely on the generosity of family and friends as their only means of assistance. This assistance accounts for an estimated $375 billion a year in “free” care—twice the amount actually spent on paid professional homecare and nursing home services combined!</p>
<p>If you’re considering this option, it is certainly not without its challenges. The economic, social, physical and psychological burdens can be substantial and long-lasting. In time, even the most loving caregiver can suffer from “burnout” and need to consider hiring professional help either part- or full-time. Fortunately, there are other options, as well.</p>

<h3>2. Non-Medical Home Care</h3>
<p>Non-Medical Home Care (also referred to as personal care, companion care or homemaker services, among other names) is much the same as a family member or other loved one coming into the home. A home care aide can assist with companionship or with the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) that may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Meal preparation</li>
    <li>House cleaning</li>
    <li>Help dressing, bathing or grooming</li>
    <li>Transportation</li>
    <li>Medication reminders</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cost</h4>
<p>Non-Medical Home Care would generally be paid for out-of-pocket (although long-term care insurance, the VA or Medicaid may help pay for it) at an average cost of $131 a day—though the caregiver could be arranged on an hourly basis with certain daily minimums, as well.</p>
<p>Home care can be wonderful as it allows the person receiving care to remain in their own home amid familiar surroundings. Depending upon the rates and the number of hours you’re looking at, however, you may find it’s actually less expensive to look into adult day care (see below) or make a move to an assisted living community.</p>

<h3>3. Home Health Care</h3>
<p>Home Health Care, which sounds similar to Non-Medical Home Care, is actually quite different. Home Health Care is clinical medical care provided in one’s own home by a registered nurse, physical therapist, occupational therapist or other skilled medical professional. Often prescribed as part of a care plan following hospitalization, Home Health may be paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other private insurance.</p>
<p>While a home health care aide may assist with any or all of the ADLs that a home care aide can provide, they may also:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Administer medication (including IVs and injections)</li>
    <li>Assist patients with Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia</li>
    <li>Assist with recovery from illness or injury</li>
    <li>Care for wounds such as pressure sores or surgical incisions</li>
    <li>Expertise in specific medical conditions (like Alzheimer’s disease or dementia)</li>
    <li>Manage diabetes through glucose monitoring and insulin injections</li>
    <li>Manage pain medications</li>
    <li>Monitor medical equipment</li>
    <li>Monitor vital signs</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cost</h4>
<p>As home health care is obtained through a prescription, home health is generally covered by medical insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid, although the individual being care for must be homebound and the home healthcare agency must be Medicare-certified.</p>

<h3>4. Adult Day Care or Respite Care</h3>
<p>Adult Day Care Centers are designed to provide care and companionship for older adults who need assistance or supervision during the day. Their programs offer relief to family members and caregivers, allowing them to go to work, handle personal business, or just relax while knowing their relative is well cared for and safe.</p>
<p>The goals of an adult day care or respite care centers are to delay or prevent placement in a care facility by providing alternative care, enhance self-esteem, and encourage socialization. There are now basically three types of models for adult day care.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Adult social day care with social services, activities, crafts and some individual attention from workers</li>
    <li>A medical model with the same services as above but also skilled services from nurses, therapists, social workers, psychiatrists, geriatric physicians and others</li>
    <li>An Alzheimer's model with services specifically designed to support and care for Alzheimer's patients</li>
</ul>

<h4>Adult Social Day Care</h4>
<p>Adult social day care provides social activities, meals, recreation, and some health-related services. A senior benefit from an adult day care because it:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allows them to stay in his or her community while the caregiver goes to work</li>
    <li>Gives them a break from the caregiver</li>
    <li>Provides needed social interaction</li>
    <li>Provides greater structure to their daily activities</li>
</ul>

<p>Services may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Counseling</li>
    <li>Education</li>
    <li>Evening care</li>
    <li>Exercise</li>
    <li>Health screening</li>
    <li>Meals</li>
    <li>Medical care</li>
    <li>Medication management</li>
    <li>Physical therapy</li>
    <li>Recreation</li>
    <li>Respite care</li>
    <li>Socialization</li>
    <li>Supervision</li>
    <li>Transportation</li>
</ul>
<p>Social activities can include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cooking</li>
    <li>Crafts</li>
    <li>Exercise</li>
    <li>Field trips</li>
    <li>Games</li>
    <li>Gardening</li>
    <li>Music therapy</li>
    <li>Parties</li>
    <li>Pet therapy</li>
</ul>
<h4>Medical or Alzheimer’s Day Care</h4>
<p>Medical or Alzheimer’s Day Care differs from adult social day care in that it offers health services. In doing so, adult day care providers can be paid for their services under special Medicaid programs or under Medicaid waiver programs for home care.</p>
<p>As the objective is to keep seniors active and keep them out of an institution, Medicaid sees these services as a viable alternative to placing people in a more expensive nursing home. At the same time Medicaid is offering rest to caregivers in the home by providing these services outside of the home.</p>
<h4>Cost</h4>
<p>The cost of daycare or respite varies with the type of agency and the services needed, but <a href="https://www.genworth.com/about-us/industry-expertise/cost-of-care.html" target="_blank">averages about $70 a day</a>. Federal and/or state programs through the <a href="https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/Resources/Factsheets/Respite_Care.aspx" target="_blank">Area Agencies on Aging (AAA)</a> may help you to pay for it.</p>
<p>While transportation to and from an adult day care or respite care center may be a challenge, many centers provide shuttle services and most urban areas also have free or very affordable paratransit services for the elderly or disabled.</p>
<p>To find out more about centers where you live, contact your local aging information and assistance provider or Area Agency on Aging (AAA). For help connecting to these agencies, contact the Eldercare Locator at 1-800-677-1116 or <a href="https://eldercare.acl.gov" target="_blank">https://eldercare.acl.gov</a>.</p>
<p>The National Adult Day Services Association is also a good source for general information about adult day care centers, programs, and associations. Call 1-877-745-1440 or visit<a href="http://www.nadsa.org" target="_blank">http://www.nadsa.org</a>.</p>

<h3>5. Veteran’s Adult Day Care or Respite Care</h3>
<p>In addition to local options for day care or respite, the VA also offers options so that veterans might enjoy social activities, support, companionship, and recreation in the company of their peers.</p>
<h4>Adult Day Health Care</h4>
<p>The program is for Veterans who need skilled services, case management and help with their ADLs. Designed for Veterans who are isolated or their caregiver needs respite, it can be used in combination with other Home and Community Based Services, as well.</p>
<p>Adult Day Health Care can be a half-day or full-day program. Usually, the veteran goes to an Adult Day Health Care center 2 to 3 times per week, but they may be able to go up to 5 times a week. Health services such as care from nurses, therapists, social workers, and others may also be available.</p>
<h4>Respite Care</h4>
<p>If you are already providing caregiving to a veteran and need assistance, <a href="https://www.va.gov/GERIATRICS/Guide/LongTermCare/Respite_Care.asp" target="_blank">Respite Care</a> through the VA is also available. pays for a caregiver to come to a Veteran's home or for a Veteran to go to a program while their family caregiver takes a break.</p>
<p>Through Respite Care, the caregiver can take a break while the veteran receives care through either of three different means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A paid Home Health Aide could come to their home</li>
    <li>They could attend an Adult Day Health Care center</li>
    <li>They could go to a Community Living Center (VA Nursing Home) or a VA medical center for a short inpatient stay</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cost</h4>
<p>These programs may be provided at VA medical centers, State Veterans Homes, or community organizations. For a list of State Veterans Homes locations, visit the <a href="http://www.nasvh.org/StateHomes/statedir.cfm" target="_blank">National Association of State Veterans Homes</a>.
