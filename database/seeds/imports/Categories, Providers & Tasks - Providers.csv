 - Caring for someone with Alzheimer’s and other related dementias
 - Safe medication management to improve health outcomes and quality of life for aging Oregonians
 -  Specialized training for public safety workers on Alzheimer’s and other related dementias
 
Established in 2014, Oregon Care Partners is part of a broad scale caregiver training initiative, funded by the state of Oregon, and designed to provide consistent, standardized, evidence-based caregiver training which is currently not available to all caregiver segments or areas of the state. The growing aging population and those with disabilities has emphasized the overwhelming need for a well-trained workforce and the development of additional community resources for both professional and family caregivers.

Oregon Care Partners offers training in collaboration with many statewide long-term care and non-profit organizations who share a vision and concern for the quality of life and care of aging Oregonians. The goal of the Initiative is to help caregivers understand how to best manage the care, services and support for the people they care for and improve the quality of life for aging Oregonians through improved access to high-quality, free education.
